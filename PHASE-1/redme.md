# ⚓ Indian Navy SQL Database System
### 🚀 DBMS Final Project by *Sahil Mate*

---

## 🧭 Overview
The **Indian Navy SQL Database System** is a comprehensive relational database project designed to model and manage various real-world operations of the Indian Navy.  
It covers personnel management, ships and aircraft tracking, logistics, training programs, operations, medical records, and maintenance scheduling — all within a robust SQL-based framework.

This project demonstrates advanced **Database Management System (DBMS)** concepts including:
- Data normalization
- Primary & foreign key constraints
- Data integrity
- Relational joins
- Real-world SQL operations (DDL, DML, DQL)
- Advanced querying and data analysis

---

## 🧩 Project Objectives
- To design a **realistic defense-grade naval database** using MySQL.
- To implement **data relationships and constraints** across multiple entities.
- To perform **real-life analytical queries** for operational insights.
- To showcase full coverage of **DBMS commands** including CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, DROP, and TRUNCATE.

## 🔍 Sample Operations
```sql
-- Display all active ships
SELECT ship_name, ship_type, commission_date
FROM Ships
WHERE current_status = 'Active';

-- Find personnel trained in Anti-Submarine Warfare
SELECT p.full_name, t.course_name
FROM Personnel p
JOIN Personnel_Enlistment e ON p.personnel_id = e.personnel_id
JOIN Training_Courses t ON e.course_id = t.course_id
WHERE t.course_name LIKE '%Submarine%';

-- Show all ongoing maintenance schedules
SELECT asset_type, maintenance_type, status
FROM Maintenance_Schedule
WHERE status = 'In Progress';
