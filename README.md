# 🇮🇳 MYSQL FINAL PROJECT – INDIAN NAVY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

![Indian Navy Banner](assets/indian-navy-banner.jpg)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a **robust, secure, and scalable MySQL database** to efficiently manage the critical operational data of the **Indian Navy**. The system is designed to streamline and centralize data management related to:

- 👨‍✈️ Naval Personnel  
- 🚢 Ships  
- 🎯 Missions  
- 🏢 Departments  
- 🎓 Trainings  
- ⚙️ Logistics and Resources

---

## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal is to:
- Implement a **relational database model** using MySQL.
- Handle real-world operations such as tracking **naval staff**, **ship movements**, **mission outcomes**, and **resource allocations**.
- Apply core **DBMS concepts** like constraints, normalization, joins, and integrity.
- Provide meaningful **analytical insights** using SQL queries.

## 🧪 How to Run the Project

1. 🚀 Open **MySQL Workbench** or **phpMyAdmin**.
2. 🏗️ Run:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE IndianNavyDB;
   USE IndianNavyDB;
````

3. 📄 Execute `tables.sql` to create all 10 tables.
4. 🧾 Run `inserts.sql` to populate sample data (20+ records per table).
5. 📊 Use `queries.sql` to run analysis and reports.
