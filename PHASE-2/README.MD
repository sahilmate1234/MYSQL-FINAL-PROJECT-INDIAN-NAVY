# ‚öì Indian Navy SQL Database System ‚Äì Phase 2  
### sqlProject by *Sahil Mate*

## üß≠ Project Overview
This project ‚Äî **Indian Navy SQL Database (Phase 2)** ‚Äî is a continuation and enhancement of the Phase 1 Indian Navy Database.  
It simulates the real-life management system of the **Indian Navy**, implementing advanced SQL concepts for handling personnel, ships, aircraft, bases, training, logistics, and operations.

The database integrates multiple relational entities using SQL commands and constraints to reflect authentic defense operations, data dependencies, and workflows.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Apply **advanced SQL operations**: `ALTER`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `RENAME`, and `SELECT`.  
- Enhance **data relationships** between multiple entities using foreign keys.  
- Simulate **real-life defense scenarios** and naval data analytics.  
- Demonstrate **data integrity, normalization, and referential constraints**.  
- Execute **DDL, DML, and DQL** operations for complex naval systems.

## üß© Example SQL Operations

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Select Query (Personnel)
```sql
SELECT name, post, base_posting_id
FROM Personnel
WHERE is_active = TRUE AND post LIKE '%Commander%';

UPDATE Ships
SET refit_due_year = 2026
WHERE status = 'Active' AND class LIKE '%Destroyer%';

3Ô∏è‚É£ Delete Query (Maintenance)
DELETE FROM Maintenance_Schedule
WHERE status = 'Completed' AND actual_end IS NOT NULL;

4Ô∏è‚É£ Alter Table Query (Weapons)
ALTER TABLE Weapons
ADD COLUMN last_maintenance DATE;
